# Welcome! #

The main issue at the moment is the incomplete documentation. This will be addressed in the next couple of weeks.

Also, we have created a downloadable package as a ZIP file with all components, so you don't have to use SVN to get the code.

If you have any remarks, bug reports or feature requests, you can leave a comment below or mail the developers.

We would be happy if somebody took this code and ported it to another (Cortex based) MCU.
